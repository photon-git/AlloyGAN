## Inverse Materials Design by Large Language Model-AssistedðŸš€ Generative FrameworkðŸ“ˆ
Deep generative models hold great promise for inverse materials design, yet their efficiency and accuracy remain constrained by data scarcity. Here, we introduce AlloyGAN, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted text mining with Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to enhance data diversity and improve inverse design. Taking alloy discovery as a case study, AlloyGAN systematically refines material candidates through iterative screening and experimental validation. For metallic glasses, the framework predicts thermodynamic properties with discrepancies of less than 8\% from experiments, demonstrating its robustness. By bridging generative AI with domain knowledge and validation workflows, AlloyGAN offers a scalable approach to accelerate the discovery of materials with tailored properties, paving the way for broader applications in materials science.

## Installation

For installing, follow these intructions
```
conda create -n alloygan python=3.8
conda activate alloygan
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data preparation 

The collected data in PDF format has been placed in the main directory`./Collected Alloy Dataset.pdf`. The complete Alloy dataset will be released later and made available for download.

 *Training*
 ---
Running training of GAN model and CGAN model on alloy dataset:


```
python main.py --model GAN --is_train True --download False   --dataroot datasets/alloys/   --dataset alloys  --epochs 100 --cuda True --batch_size 2

python main.py --model CGAN --is_train True --download False   --dataroot datasets/alloys/   --dataset alloys  --epoch 100 --cuda True --batch_size 2
```

Start tensorboard:

```
tensorboard --logdir ./logs/
```
